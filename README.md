# T.EX - The Transparency EXtension - v1

T.EX is a Web extension for Chrome and Chromium-based browsers to visualize data flows and relationships between websites. It is inspired by [Lightbeam](https://github.com/mozilla/lightbeam-we) for Firefox. The development of this Web extension has been discussed in the paper [Towards Real-Time Web Tracking Detection with T. EX-The Transparency EXtension](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebastian-Zickau/publication/334745947_Towards_Real-Time_Web_Tracking_Detection_with_TEX_-_The_Transparency_EXtension/links/5d9c5f0892851c2f70f43b54/Towards-Real-Time-Web-Tracking-Detection-with-TEX-The-Transparency-EXtension.pdf).
